GetNodeTriads (SWIG)
''''''''''''''''''''

.. function:: GetNodeTriads(Graph, NId, GroupSet)
   :noindex:

Returns the number of closed triads between a node *NId* and a subset of its neighbors in *GroupSet* as well as the number of triads for cases where neighbors are not in *GroupSet*.
Considers *Graph* to be undirected.

Parameters:

- *Graph*: graph (input)
    A Snap.py graph or a network

- *NId*: int (input)
    NId of the node of interest

- *GroupSet*: TIntSet (input)
    Set of NIds representing a subset of the neighbors of the node of interest


Return value:

- list: [int, int, int, int]
    The list contains four elements: the first two elements are the number of closed triads between *NId* and nodes in *GroupSet*, the third element is the number of triads between *NId* and a node in *GroupSet* and another node not in *GroupSet*, the fourth element is the number of triads between *NId* and two nodes not in *GroupSet*.

The following example shows how to calculate the number of triads a node participates in for nodes in
:class:`TNGraph`, :class:`TUNGraph`, and :class:`TNEANet`::

    import snap

    Graph = snap.GenFull(snap.PNGraph, 100)
    NI = Graph.Nodes().next()
    NId = NI.GetId()
    GroupSet = snap.TIntSet()
    for NbrIdx in range(4):
        GroupSet.AddKey(NI.GetOutNId(NbrIdx))
    result = snap.GetNodeTriads(Graph, NId, GroupSet)
    print("number of triads between", NId, " and two set members", result[0])
    print("number of triads between", NId, " and a set member and a set non-member", result[2])
    print("number of triads between", NId, " and two set non-members", result[3])

    Graph = snap.GenFull(snap.PUNGraph, 100)
    NI = Graph.Nodes().next()
    NId = NI.GetId()
    GroupSet = snap.TIntSet()
    for NbrIdx in range(4):
        GroupSet.AddKey(NI.GetOutNId(NbrIdx))
    result = snap.GetNodeTriads(Graph, NId, GroupSet)
    print("number of triads between", NId, " and two set members", result[0])
    print("number of triads between", NId, " and a set member and a set non-member", result[2])
    print("number of triads between", NId, " and two set non-members", result[3])

    Graph = snap.GenFull(snap.PNEANet, 100)
    NI = Graph.Nodes().next()
    NId = NI.GetId()
    GroupSet = snap.TIntSet()
    for NbrIdx in range(4):
        GroupSet.AddKey(NI.GetOutNId(NbrIdx))
    result = snap.GetNodeTriads(Graph, NId, GroupSet)
    print("number of triads between", NId, " and two set members", result[0])
    print("number of triads between", NId, " and a set member and a set non-member", result[2])
    print("number of triads between", NId, " and two set non-members", result[3])
