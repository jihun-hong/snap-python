Snap.py is a Python interface for SNAP. SNAP is a general purpose, high
performance system for analysis and manipulation of large networks. SNAP
is written in C++ and optimized for maximum performance and compact graph
representation. It easily scales to massive networks with hundreds of
millions of nodes, and billions of edges.

Snap.py provides performance benefits of SNAP, combined with flexibility
of Python. Most of the SNAP functionality is available via Snap.py in Python.
